# MoST Research Unit @ Fondazione Bruno Kessler

Welcome! ðŸ™Œ

We are a research unit of the [Digital Society center](https://digis.fbk.eu)
at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu) in Trento, Italy.

MoST means Modeling and Simulation of Socio-Technical Systems. We develop
AI and data-empowered models and simulation techniques for understanding
complex socio-technical systems.

Our principal investigator is [@pistore](https://github.com/pistore).

We use this GitHub organization to collaborate and host the code developed as
part of our research projects and activities.

Please, use the [issues repository](https://github.com/fbk-most/issues) to
report issues and suggest improvements to our codebases. Thank you!
